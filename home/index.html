    <h1>Alex Osler Personal Website</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my website! I'm a rising senior computer science student,
      currently studying at Worcester Polytechnic Institute (WPI). If you're looking to see
      more about my professional credentials, feel free to check out my resume. If you're
      curious about the projects I've been doing for work and fun, take a look at my projects.
    </p>
    <h2>Who is Alex Osler?</h2>
    <p>I've been into technology for as long as I can remember, and this mostly stems from
    my interest in customization. Every person is different, and I love learning and implementing
    new technologies to make my daily environment just a little more comfortable, or aesthetically pleasing.
    </p><p>
    Outside of technology, I spend a lot of my time playing competitive fighting video games, and specifically
    competing in Super Smash Bros  Project M, Melee, and Ultimate. As part of this, I co-run the Super Smash Bros Club
    at WPI. During the school year we run weekly tournaments on Saturdays, so if you're interested come play!    <p>
